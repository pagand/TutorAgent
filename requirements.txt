# --- Vector Store ---
# chromadb 0.4.13 is quite old (Dec 2023). Let's try a newer patch version
# that is known to work with numpy < 2.0 and recent Langchain.
# 0.4.24 is from Mar 2024. If issues persist, you might need 0.5.x,
# but that might have stricter dependencies.
chromadb>=0.4.24,<0.5.0
# Let pip resolve grpcio unless you face build issues, especially on M1/M2 Mac.
# If pip install fails here, try uncommenting and pinning a recent version:
